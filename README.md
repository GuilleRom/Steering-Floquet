# Steering-Floquet
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for reproducing the results in our article "Steering spin fluctuations in lattice systems via two-tone Floquet engineering" published in Physica Scripta https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1402-4896/ad9d85. Our work considers a one-dimensional spin-1/2 lattice with periodically modulated bonds using parametric resonances. Quantum dynamics is studied by using exact diagonalization (ED) up to L=10 spins.  

Summary of results:

1. We report on the controlled creation and destruction of antiferromagnetic dimers using two-tone Floquet engineering.
2. The stroboscopic dynamics generated from distributed bond modulations lead to pair correlation between spins. Consequently, subharmonic response in local observables breaks discrete time translational symmetry and leads to the emergence of Floquet dynamical dimerization.
3. We present a protocol allowing the control of local spin-correlated pairs driven by one-period evolution operators, providing significant insight into new nonequilibrium states of matter.
