In our work, we report on the controlled creation and destruction of antiferromagnetic dimers using two-tone Floquet engineering. We consider a one-dimensional spin-1/2 lattice with periodically modulated bonds using parametric resonances. The stroboscopic dynamics generated from distributed bond modulations lead to pair correlation between spins. Consequently, subharmonic response in local observables breaks discrete time translational symmetry and leads to the emergence of Floquet dynamical dimerization. We present a protocol allowing the control of local spin-correlated pairs driven by one-period evolution operators, providing significant insight into new nonequilibrium states of matter that can be feasibly implemented in current quantum simulator platforms.
